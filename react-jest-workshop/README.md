This is a workshop for learning how to test [React][React] with the [Jest][Jest] testing framework and the
[Enzyme][Enzyme] testing library.

## Project Setup

This project assumes you have [NodeJS v6](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed. It's also recommended to use the
[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) client (rather than [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)). If you'd rather stick with `npm`,
that's fine. Just replace `yarn` with `npm` in the instructions below and hope that things don't break üòè.
You'll also need a recent version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed as well.

With that, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-jest-workshop.git
cd react-jest-workshop
yarn run setup
```

If the `yarn run setup` script finishes without errors (don't worry about warnings) then you're good to go. Otherwise,
please [file an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

## Testing Instructions

There are two directories in this project that you should be interested in:

- `exercises`: Where the unfinished tests are (where you should add your tests).
- `exercises-final`: Where the finished tests are (where you can reference if you get stuck).

The tests in `exercises` are actually all scaffolded for you. So your goal is to go through and write all the tests. Do this:

1. Run `yarn run watch:test` which will start running the tests in watch mode, meaning that as you save your file, it
will automatically re-run your tests so you can quickly see how you're doing.
2. Choose a file in the `exercises` directory that ends in `.test.js` and implement the tests one-by-one.

Good luck!
